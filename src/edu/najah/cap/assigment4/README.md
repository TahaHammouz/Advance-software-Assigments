# Design Pattern
    
Firstly, we need to check the RGB values range, so I create an interface, implement it in class, and create a function to verify whether the RGB value is valid and return an object with valid values

The second interface I have implemented is for getting the color from the cache or creating it in the hashmap, with the main idea being to not create the same values twice. 

In my static block, I have set the default values 

I've created another hashmap with default values that prints the name of the color if the main hashmap has the same default values, otherwise it prints the RGB values.

Ps. by mistake, i deleted the branch so i had to restore it and create another README
